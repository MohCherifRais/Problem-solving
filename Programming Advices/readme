# Here is the roadmap that I follow @ Programming advices online Academy. 
The roadmap is divided into 3 parts 
1- Starting with a solid background using C++, OOP and data structures 
2- C# and Databases to build complete desktop applications using Windows forms 
3- learn advanced topics like Rest API and solid principles.
After this step, you can switch to any field (web, mobile)
